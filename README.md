## Welcome to my GitHub page

This [page](https://icfly2.github.io/) serves as a langing page for a range of different projects I have been working on and are being moved to github as a central location. It also serves a a scratch pad for ideas.

## Topics
There are several topics I am interested in that I share content about here:

### Sailing
- Rigging and cheating at the americas cup, a statistical analysis
- A self learning autpilot in python
- Optimal stochastic routing through a set of weather systems
- ML on the yacht designs dataset to elp design optimal hulls under given constriants

### Computation
- simple multiprcessing for pandas
- [a nice dynamic and stocastic programming solver](https://icfly2.github.io/hjb_solvers/)
- Baysian deep learning

### Deployment
- a simple dashboard in flask, pandas and bokeh
- a machine learning service behind an API built with starAPI and sklearn
- markdown to presentation converter, to mae nice and distributable presentations with notes
